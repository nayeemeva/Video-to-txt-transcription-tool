  1.Audio Extraction: Converting the audio portion of each video into a format suitable for processing.
  2.Speech-to-Text Conversion: Translating the Bengali audio into text.
I'll provide an outline for a Python-based tool using Google Speech-to-Text API (which supports Bengali). However, this requires an internet connection and access to Google Cloud's paid services.




Step 1: Install Required Packages
Install ffmpeg to extract audio from video files.
Use pydub for additional audio processing.
Use google-cloud-speech for transcription.


Step 2: Set Up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
Sign up on Google Cloud Platform and create a project.
Enable the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
Create a service account key and download the JSON key file.


Set up the Google API key as an environment variable in your terminal:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your-service-account-file.json"



Explanation of the Code
extract_audio: This function extracts the audio from a video file and converts it to a .wav format.
transcribe_audio: This function sends the audio file to Googleâ€™s API and retrieves the transcription in Bengali.
process_videos: This function iterates over each video file, processes it, and stores the transcription.
Running the Script
Add all your video file paths to the video_paths list.
Run the script.
A file named transcripts.txt will contain all the transcriptions.
